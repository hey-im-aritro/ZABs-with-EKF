Its pretty simple in terms of code execution
Just download the files
Use MATLAB Online (no need to download extra stuff)
Open MATLAB Drive -> Create new Folder -> Upload all the files there
Open MainScript.m
Run the Code (the code has been divided into sections - if the figures dont show up, run each section individually)
